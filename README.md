Online forecasting methods for heat load are built under recursive least squares (RLS) and recursive maximum likelihood (RML) frameworks. The hyperparameters are optimized using cross-validation methods. The performance of the algorithms are evaluated using RMSE, MAE and CRPS and their improvements compared to a benchmark.
